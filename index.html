                    <ul>
                        <li>A list of IP addresses known by itself and peers.</li>

                    <h2>Consensus</h2>
                    <h3>The consensus algorithm attempts to solve two problems:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What transactions are committed to the blockchain?</li>
                        <li>How does new coin get injected into the system?</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>We want to inject new coins in a way that rewards actors contributing to the system.</p>
                    <p>Consensus gives us a perfect opportunity for this.</p>
                    <p>We can reward actors that validate and commit transactions to the blockchain.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>What transactions are committed to the blockchain?</h2>
                    <h3>We could use the leader/follower pattern of Raft and let leaders confirm transactions.</h3>
                    <aside class="notes">The slides on Raft are included because the previous talk at the Austin Distributed Systems Enthusiast Meetup was on Raft.</aside>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>But in Raft, we would invite race-to-leader abuse when being a leader is reward-able.</p>
                    <p>And, our nodes aren't tied to a entity we could reward (address, person, etc.)</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>So instead of using something like Raft, we have <em>mining.</em></p>
                    <p class="fragment">
                        A miner:
                    <ol>
                        <li class="fragment">Asks a node for a <em>block</em> of uncommitted valid txs.</li>
                        <li class="fragment">Adds a reward-me tx of its own to the block.</li>
                        <li class="fragment">Performs proof-of-work that signs block as confirmed.</li>
                        <li class="fragment">If able to successfully confirm block, has node broadcast it as part of blockchain.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Proof-of-Work</h2>
                    Bulk of the work is artificially difficult as a way to throttle the system:
<pre><code data-trim>
while true:
    block_hash = SHA256(SHA256(EndianFlipEvery32Bits(data + nonce)))
    if block_hash < difficulty_target:
        tell everyone about our new block in the blockchain
        exit and try to generate/mine another block
    else:
        nonce = nonce + 1
</code>
</pre>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Mining presents its own distributed system problem</h3>
                    <h4>Needing to scale computation as difficulty increases.</h4>
                    <p>Miners have started participating in <em>mining pools</em>, working together to generate confirmed blocks.</p>
